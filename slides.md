### How to check if a number is prime using regex?

---

## Like this?

```ruby
def prime?(n)
  n.to_s.match? /^(2|3|5|7)$/
end
```

---

### What about 11, 13 and others?

```ruby
(0..100).select { prime?(_1) }
#=> [2, 3, 5, 7]
```

---

```ruby
def prime?(n)
  '1'*n !~ /^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/
end
```

---

```ruby
(0..100).select { prime?(_1) }
#=> [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, (...), 89, 97]
```

---

### How does it work?
