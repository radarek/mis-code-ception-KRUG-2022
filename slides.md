### How to check if a number is prime using regex?

---

## What is a prime number?

{:.fragment}
It is an integer number > 1 that is divisible only by itself and 1.

{:.fragment}
6 is not prime because divides by 1, 2, 3 and 6.

{:.fragment}
7 is prime because it divides only by 1 and 7.

---

## Regex check, like this?

```ruby
def prime?(n)
  n.to_s.match? /^(2|3|5|7)$/
end
```

---

```ruby
(0..100).select { prime?(_1) }
#=> [2, 3, 5, 7]
```

## What about 11, 13 and others?

---

# Ready?

---

```ruby
def prime?(n)
  '1'*n !~ /^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/
end
```

---

```ruby
(0..100).select { prime?(_1) }
#=> [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, (...), 89, 97]
```

---

## How does it work?

---

```ruby
'1'*n !~ /^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/
```
